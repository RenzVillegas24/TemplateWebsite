    <h1>What is Technology?</h1>
    <p>
      Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to real-world problems, either
      by industry or in our daily lives. Basically, we employ technology whenever we apply
      our scientific knowledge to attain a specific goal. There's a little more to it than that,
      hough. Technology usually entails the use of a certain piece of equipment, which might
      be either extremely simple or dazzlingly sophisticated. It may be anything from the
      invention of the wheel to computers, smartphones and smart home appliances.

      <h2>Why should we study Technology?</h2>
      <p>
        We must study technology in order to obtain a better grasp of our environment. We must understand how we use it
        in our daily lives and how critical it is. We must study technology in order to understand the foundations of
        today's inventions, machinery, and technology. It is necessary to study technology in order to understand how
        our lives will change in the future.<br><br>
        Technology is significant because it is an integral component of our daily lives. It speeds up our job and makes
        our lives easier. However, it has the potential to harm our life. We should research technology to see what
        benefits and drawbacks it may have for us.<br><br></p>

      <p>
        There can be no growth without technology. That is why we must understand what technology is and study it in
        order to understand what else it can provide for us, how long it will last, and how we can manage the resources
        it provides.<br><br>
        Furthermore, by grasping technology, we can resolve some minor flaws that can arise in any system. Not to
        mention, people cannot progress without technology; the internet, which you are using right now to surf the web,
        is a form of technology that has become a daily necessity; the current state of human life is that we cannot
        survive without it. Technology has advanced at a breakneck pace in recent decades. After all, whether we utilize
        technology appropriately or misuse it is all up to us. Technology advances at a breakneck pace every second, so
        we must keep up by studying it.
