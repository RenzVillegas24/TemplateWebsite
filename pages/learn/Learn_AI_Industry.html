			<h1>Artificial Intelligence in the Industry.</h1>
			<p>
				Through the adoption of tools like the internet and email for communications, word processing,
				spreadsheets,
				and presentations for office productivity, electronic databases for record keeping, and robots and
				artificial intelligence for automation, technology has evolved and shaped our workplaces in many ways.

				Technology has become an indispensible part of our working lives, pervading every element of business
				and
				public life.

			<h2>Precense of Artificial Intelligence in our Daily Lives</h2>

			</figure>
			<p>
				Artificial intelligence (AI) is generally depicted in pop culture as a horde of intelligent robots
				hell-bent on
				destroying humanity, or at the very least a posh theme park. Sentient machines with general artificial
				intelligence do not exist yet, and are unlikely to do so in the near future, therefore we're secure...
				for the
				time being.
			</p>
			<p>
				That isn't to dismiss AI's possible impact on our collective future. More than 72 percent of Americans
				expressed
				concern in a recent poll about a future in which machines do many human tasks.Artificial intelligence is
				all around us, whether we recognize it or not, and it plays a significant role in our
				daily lives. AI is lurking in the background every time we open our Facebook newsfeed, do a Google
				search, get
				an Shopee or Lazada product recommendation, or book a trip online.

				<figcaption>Robots replacing workers.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Industry leaders still can’t agree on what the term “robot” embodies. Roboticists understand robots to
				be programmable machines that carry out tasks, but nobody can pinpoint exactly where that definition
				ends. Today's AI-powered robots, or at least those machines deemed as such, possess no natural general
				intelligence, but they are capable of solving problems and "thinking" in a limited capacity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many personnel, particularly in the manufacturing industry, currently work with autonomous robots.
				Many other areas, such as warehouse logistics, office cleaning, and building security, are rapidly
				demonstrating this trend.

				Human workers are beginning to adapt to this new reality as more and more robots operate alongside and
				in tandem with them.

			</figure>
			<p>
				The self-driving automobile industry's future is actually being driven by artificial intelligence.
				These vehicles are equipped with sensors that constantly monitor what is going on around them and use
				artificial intelligence to make the necessary modifications. Every millisecond, these sensors gather
				hundreds of data points (such as car speed, road conditions, pedestrian location, other traffic, and so
				on),
				and then utilize AI to understand the data and act on it—all in the blink of an eye. We may still have a
				long
				way to go before we're entirely capable of driving autonomously.
			</p>
			<p>
				AI is making it easier to go around, from making flight bookings to recommending the most efficient way
				home after work.
				Travel companies are taking advantage of the widespread use of smartphones.
				More than 70% of users say they use their phones to plan vacations, look for travel suggestions, and
				look up local sights and restaurants.
				One in every three people says they've used a virtual travel assistant to plan a vacation.

				AI-powered chatbots are transforming the travel business by allowing customers to communicate with them
				in a human-like manner, resulting in faster response times, lower booking prices, and even trip
				recommendations.

			<h2>Face Detection and Machine Recognition</h2>
			<figure>
				<img alt="Please connect to the Internet to be able to load the image"
					src="https://iili.io/5nSKue.png" />
				<figcaption>Face being processed by A.I.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				A machine can see thanks to this technology. Machine recognition uses a camera, analog-to-digital
				conversion, and digital
				signal processing to gather and analyze visual data. Machine recognition is frequently likened to human
				vision, however it is not
				limited by biology and may be programmed to see past walls, for example. From signature recognition to
				medical picture
				analysis, it's employed in a variety of applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another example of the image recognition was the usage of the TrueDepth camera on Apple iPhones which
				creates a depth map of your
				face by projecting over 30,000 invisible dots. It also takes a picture of the user's face in infrared.
				The scan of your face is
				then compared to previously enrolled facial data using a machine learning technique. It can then decide
				whether or not to
				unlock the device.

			<p>
				Artificial intelligence is proven to be a game-changer in healthcare, like bringing a robot and Ai for
				assisting the surgeries that would otherwise be impossible to conduct by a single person.
			</p>
			<p>
				Machine learning is also being used by businesses to make better and faster diagnoses than people.
				IBM Watson is one of the most well-known healthcare technologies.
				It can understand and react to questions in normal language.
				To build a hypothesis, the system mines patient data and other available data sources, which it then
				provides with a confidence grading schema.
				To forecast, battle, and understand pandemics like COVID-19, a variety of AI tools are being deployed.

			<p>
				The finance industry and AI are a perfect match.
				Because AI machines excel at accuracy, real-time reporting, and processing large amounts of quantitative data where the financial sector relies on . 
				The robo-advisor, or computerized portfolio manager, is one of the major financial phenomena of 2018.
				These automated advisors examine market data and predict the best stock or portfolio based on preferences using AI and algorithms.
				Wealth management organizations are moving to robo-advisors not just because they save time and money for both the company and the client, but also because they offer spectacular returns.

			<h2>Final Words About Artificial Intelligence</h2>
			<p>
				We come into contact with AI on a daily basis, whether we're surfing the web or listening to music on Spotify.
				Smart email apps, e-commerce, smart keyboard apps, and banking and finance are all examples of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is now a significant factor in our decisions and way of life.
			</p>
			<p>
				AI may have been portrayed in the media as a threat to human workers or as a concept that will eventually take over the world. That, however, is not the case.
				Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is assisting humans in becoming more productive and living a better life.
