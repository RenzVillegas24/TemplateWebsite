		<h1>The Internet Of Things</h1>
		<p>
			The "Internet of Things" (IoT) is becoming a more popular topic of discussion both in and out of the
			workplace. It's an idea with the potential to change not only how we live but also how we work. But what
			precisely is the "Internet of Things," and how will it affect you, if at all? There are many intricacies
			around the "Internet of Things," but I'd want to focus on the fundamentals. Many technical and
			policy-related discussions are taking place, but many individuals are still attempting to grasp the gist of
			what these discussions are about.

			</figure>
			<p>
				Simply expressed, this is the idea of connecting any device having an on/off switch to the Internet
				(and/or to each other) over the Internet. Cellphones, coffee makers, washing machines, headphones,
				lamps, wearable devices, and almost anything else fall into this category. This also applies to machine
				components, such as an airplane's jet engine or an oil rig's drill.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Gartner, there will be over 26 billion linked devices by 2020... There are a lot of links
				there (some even estimate this number to be much higher, over 100 billion). The Internet of Things (IoT)
				is a massive network of interconnected "things" (which also includes people). People-people,
				people-things, and things-things will form relationshipsu

			<h2>The Impacts.</h2>

					All of us are now connected in a cloud.

			<p>
				"Anything that can be connected, will be connected," will be the new rule for the future. But why would
				you want so many connected gadgets to communicate with one another? There are numerous instances of what
				this could look like or how valuable it could be. Let's say you're driving to a meeting; your car may
				have access to your schedule and already know the optimal path. If there is heavy traffic, your
				automobile may send a text message to the other party informing them that you will be late.
				What if your alarm clock wakes you up at 6 a.m. and then sends a signal to your coffee maker to begin
				brewing coffee for you? What if your workplace equipment detected when supplies were getting short and
				automatically reordered more? What if your workplace wearable gadget could tell you when and where you
				were most active and productive, and then share that data with other devices you used at work?
			</p>
			<p>
				On a larger scale, the Internet of Things may be used to improve transportation networks and create
				"smart cities," which can help us minimize waste and increase efficiency in areas like energy use,
				allowing us to better understand and improve how we work and live. Take a look at the illustration below
				to see what that may look like. The truth is that the Internet of Things opens up nearly unlimited
				possibilities and connections, many of which we can't even imagine or completely comprehend today. It's
				easy to see how and why the Internet of Things is such a popular issue today; it certainly opens up a
				lot of opportunities, but it also presents a lot of obstacles.

					How about the security.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Security is a major concern that is frequently raised. What can people do to ensure that their data is
				secure in a world when billions of gadgets are connected? Will a hacker be able to gain access to your
				entire network by hacking into your toaster? The Internet of Things also exposes businesses all around
				the world to new security risks. Then there's the problem of data sharing and privacy. Even now, this is
				a contentious issue, so one can only image how the debate and worries will grow when we're talking about
				billions of connected gadgets. Another challenge that many businesses will confront is the large volumes
				of data that all of these gadgets will generate. Companies must devise a method for storing, tracking,
				analyzing, and interpreting the massive volumes of data that will be generated.

				Conversations concerning the Internet of Things are taking place (and have been for several years) all
				around the world as we try to figure out how it will affect our lives. We're also trying to figure out
				what the various opportunities and problems will be when more and more devices join the Internet of
				Things. For the time being, the greatest thing we can do is educate ourselves on the Internet of Things
				and its potential impacts on how we work and live.
