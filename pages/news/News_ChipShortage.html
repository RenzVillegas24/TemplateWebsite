		<h1>The Global Chip Shortage.</h1>
		<p>
			Chips can be found in almost every electronic device you own, from your phone to your computer to your car.
			They can even be found in unexpected places, such as your washing machine, electric toothbrush, and
			refrigerator. However, these tiny components that power so much of our lives are in critical short supply
			right now. "Right now, we have a global supply chain in crisis," says Patrick Penfield, a Syracuse
			University professor
			of supply chain practice. "We've never seen anything of this magnitude have such an impact on us before."

				The chips, also known as semiconductors or microchips, are the brains of our electronic devices. They're
				tiny technological marvels that contain billions of transistors, though the chip size varies. (Those
				transistors act like tiny little gates, allowing or preventing electrons from passing through.) Their
				construction entails a number of steps, days, and the presence of experts. IBM's latest chip, for
				example, crams 50 billion transistors into a two nanometer, fingernail-sized space.

			<p>
				As the world shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many factories closed with it, making the
				supplies needed for chip manufacturing unavailable for months. Increased demand for consumer electronics
				caused shifts that rippled up the supply chain. Orders began to pile up as manufacturers struggled to
				create enough chips to meet the new levels of demand. A backlog began to grow and grow and grow.
			</p>
			<p>
				Car companies, like Ford, have to predict the amount of chips they will need to produce their cars and
				order them in advance from one of the chip manufacturers. As of now, it can take at least half of a year
				for a chip order to come in, says Penfield. The current demand for chips is so great that manufacturers
				can’t make enough chips to meet it at this time, meaning consumers will soon be seeing higher prices for
				less goods.
			</p>
			<p>
				Automobile manufacturers, such as Ford, must forecast the amount of chips they will require and order
				them in advance from one of the chip manufacturers. A chip order can currently take at least half a year
				to arrive, according to Penfield. The current demand for chips is so high that manufacturers are unable
				to meet it, implying that consumers will soon face higher prices for fewer goods. The problem, however,
				was not limited to manufacturing. As COVID spread across Asia, ports shut down, sometimes for months at
				a time. The Yantian port in China, which handles 90% of the world's electronics, was closed, leaving
				hundreds of container ships waiting to dock.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many companies canceled chip orders when COVID began because they thought the economy was about to take
				a long hit, according to Lewis. Because car companies cancelled orders, chip companies switched to
				making chips for consumer products in order to meet the pandemic's explosive demand. After retooling
				their plants to make chips for consumer goods rather than cars, there was a shortage of car chips.

			<h2>The Effects</h2>

			</figure>
			<p>“Prices are going to be higher for a lot of devices that require a semiconductor,” says David Yoffie, a
				Harvard Business School professor who served on Intel's board of directors for nearly three decades.
				"Some products aren't going to ship at all, or they will be delayed." While consumer electronics
				companies such as Apple and Samsung began stockpiling chips early on to avoid the massive delays
				experienced by the auto industry, Apple recently announced that the chip shortage is expected to delay
				iPhone production and is already affecting iPad and Mac sales. Also in short supply are Xboxes and
				Playstations.

			<h2>When Will This Ends?</h2>
			<p>
				When the shortage will end is a matter of debate. According to STMicro's CEO, the shortage will be
				resolved by early 2023. The shortage, according to Stellantis' CEO, "is going to drag into '22, easy."
				According to Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger, the shortage could last another two years. Some of the demand,
				according to Yoffie, will begin to slow down in the next 6 to 12 months. However, he believes it will
				take two years for supply to catch up to demand and equilibrium to be reached.
