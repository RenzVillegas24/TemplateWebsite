		<h1>What is 5G?</h1>
		<p>
			Following the previous generations of 2G, 3G, and 4G, 5G is the fifth generation of mobile networks. The 5G
			network is expected to provide significantly faster connection speeds than previous networks. Being more
			dependable, with faster response times and more capacity.
			5G is a ten-year investment, and previous mobile transitions have seen the majority of the major changes
			occur years after the initial announcement. Take, for example, 4G. The first 4G phones appeared in the
			United States in 2010, but it was not until later that the 4G applications that changed our world appeared.
			Snapchat debuted in 2012, and Uber gained popularity in 2013. Around 2013, video calls over LTE networks
			became popular in the United States.
			There's a new twist with the 5G transition. Low-band, mid-band, and high-band are the three main types of
			5G.

			<h2>The Origin of the Wireless Connections</h2>
			<figure>

				<figcaption>Visual representation of how wireless connection works.</figcaption>

			<p>
				The G in 5G refers to a wireless technology generation.
				While data transmission speeds have defined most generations, each has also been marked by a break
				in
				encoding methods, or "air interfaces," that renders it incompatible with previous generations.
				1G was a cellular analog. The first generation of digital cellular technologies was 2G, which
				included
				CDMA, GSM, and TDMA. Speeds ranged from 200kbps to a few megabits per second with 3G technologies
				like
				EVDO, HSPA, and UMTS. 4G technologies, such as WiMAX and LTE, were the next incompatible step
				forward,
				with speeds reaching hundreds of megabits and even gigabits.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bigger channels (to speed up data), lower latency (to be more responsive), and the ability to
				connect a lot more devices at once are all new features of 5G. (for sensors and smart devices).
			</p>

			<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
			<figure>
				<img alt="Please connect to the Internet to be able to load the image" src="https://iili.io/5ohuef.jpg" />
				<figcaption>5G wave length spectrum.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Radio frequencies (also known as spectrum) are used in wireless communications systems to transmit data
				over long distances.
				5G is similar to 4G, but it uses higher radio frequencies that are less crowded.
				This enables it to transport more data at a much faster rate.
				Millimeter waves are the higher frequency bands (mmwaves).
				Regulators have opened them up for licensing after they were previously unlicensed.
				Because the necessary equipment was both inaccessible and expensive, they had largely gone unnoticed by
				the general public.
			</p>
			<p>
				While higher bands are faster at carrying data, sending over long distances can be problematic. Physical
				objects, such as trees and buildings, can easily block them. 5G will use multiple input and output
				antennae to boost signals and capacity across the wireless network to overcome this challenge.
				Smaller transmitters will also be used in the technology. Instead of using single stand-alone masts,
				they are mounted on buildings and street furniture. According to current estimates, 5G will be able to
				support 1,000 more devices per meter than 4G.
			</p>
			<p>
				A physical network can also be sliced into multiple virtual networks using 5G technology. Operators will
				be able to deliver the appropriate network slice based on how it is being used, allowing them to better
				manage their networks. This means that, depending on the importance of the task, an operator will be
				able to use different slice capacities. Simpler devices could be separated from more complex and
				demanding applications, such as controlling autonomous vehicles, while a single user streaming a video
				would use a different slice of a business. Businesses will also be able to rent their own isolated and
				insulated network slice to keep them separate from other Internet traffic.

			<h2>Who Invented 5G?</h2>
			<figure>
				<img alt="Please connect to the Internet to be able to load the image" src="https://iili.io/5ohT5G.jpg"  />
				<figcaption>South Korea's Launch of the World's First National 5G Networks.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				South Korea was the first country to adopt the technology on a large scale, with 224 operators in 88
				countries investing in the technology as of April 2019.

				Except for one 5G carrier in South Korea, which used Huawei equipment, all 5G carriers in the country
				used Samsung, Ericsson, and Nokia base stations and equipment. Samsung was the largest of these
				suppliers, having shipped 53,000 base stations out of a total of 86,000 base stations in the country at
				the time.

				There are nine companies selling 5G radio hardware and systems to carriers right now. Altiostar, Cisco
				Systems, Datang Telecom, Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm, Samsung, and ZTE are among these companies.

			<h2>The Advantages</h2>
			<figure>
				<img alt="Please connect to the Internet to be able to load the image" src="https://iili.io/5ohIJs.jpg"  />
				<figcaption>Fastest speed recorded in 5G using a phone.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The most obvious advantage of 5G networks over 4G networks is network speed. However, there are
				advantages to lower latency, which means faster response times and faster download speeds. Because of
				the increased operational efficiency, this opens up a plethora of potential applications across
				industries. Superfast broadband without the need for landlines, 5G mobile telecommunications, the
				creation of smart factories, holographic technologies, televisions, remote healthcare, and driverless
				cars with 5G communication and car-to-car communication are just a few of the applications for 5G.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reduced latency will enable many of these technological advancements, allowing 5G devices to respond to
				commands faster. The time between issuing a command and receiving a response is known as latency. 3G has
				a latency of 65 milliseconds, advanced 4G has a latency of around 40 milliseconds, and fixed broadband
				has a latency of 10-20 milliseconds. 5G, on the other hand, is expected to have a latency of as little
				as 1 millisecond, allowing mission-critical and Internet-of-Things applications to operate below the 4
				millisecond target for an enhanced mobile broadband service.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, the technology will have a higher capacity than previous network technologies. Networks
				will have access to more spectrum at higher frequencies, allowing them to handle more high-demand
				applications at the same time. As a result, it may be able to provide a fibre-like experience for fixed
				wireless applications, allowing those in hard-to-reach areas to benefit from significantly improved
				broadband service. As previously stated, the main selling point of 5G is the network's speed. With some
				speculating that peak speeds could exceed 10Gps in the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				Initial speeds are expected to be lower, with EE claiming peak speeds of more than 1Gps, which is still
				100-150 Mbps faster than 4G speeds, which should total 130-240 Mbps. Meanwhile, when the Three network
				launches 5G, it will offer speeds of over 2Gps.
				However, real-world factors such as your distance from a base station and how many other people are
				connected to the network at the same time must be considered. However, even in these conditions, the
				user-experienced data rate for downloads is expected to be at least 100Mbps, which is still
				significantly faster than 4G.

			<h2>Will 5G take the place of 4G? When?</h2>
			<p>
				5G isn't going to take over from 4G anytime soon. Some experts believe it will be decades before 4G is
				completely phased out. Initial 5G deployments will rely on existing 4G LTE infrastructure. The first
				rollouts are expected to take place in the busiest areas.
				Between 2019 and the end of 2020, 5G will be available in 26 cities across the United Kingdom. The first
				cities to prepare for this new technology are expected to be London, Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh,
				Cardiff, and Belfast.
