		<h1>Meet ARM, the Future of Computing.</h1>
		<p>
			ARM (formerly Advanced RISC Machine) is a family of RISC (reduced instruction set computing) architectures
			for computer processors that can be configured for different environments. Arm Holdings develops the
			architecture and licenses it to other companies such as Apple, Qualcomm, and others, who then design their
			own products based on one of the architectures, such as systems-on-chips (SoCs) and systems-on-modules
			(SoMs) that include memory, interfaces, radios, and other components. It also creates cores that implement
			this instruction set, which it licenses to a number of companies who use the core designs in their own
			products.

		<P>
			ARM processors with a RISC architecture typically require fewer transistors than processors with a complex
			instruction set computing (CISC) architecture (such as the x86 processors found in most personal computers),
			which reduces cost, power consumption, and heat dissipation. Light, portable, battery-powered devices, such
			as smartphones and tablet computers, and other embedded systems, benefit from these characteristics. ARM
			could also be a viable power-efficient solution for supercomputers, which consume a lot of electricity.

			<h2>The BIG Move: Apple's M1</h2>

			<p>
				Apple announced its plan to transition its Mac lineup to Apple silicon in June of 2021, abandoning
				Intel, its SoC supplier for Macs since 2006. According to the Cupertino-giant, the transition will take
				two
				years and will establish a common architecture that will empower app developers to better write and
				optimize
				apps for the entire ecosystem. Following through on its promise, Apple unveiled its latest Mac lineup
				powered by Apple's silicon a few months later, at the 'One More Thing' event (M1).
			</p>
			<p>
				Apple M1 is the company's first ARM-based SoC (system on a chip). It currently powers the Mac mini,
				MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro (13′′) and is based on TSMC's 5nm node. To put things in perspective,
				Apple's latest iPhone processor, the A14, is also based on TSMC's 5nm node. The M1 is the first
				commercial computer chip built using the 5nm process, according to Apple, and it contains an incredible
				16 billion transistors.

			<p>
				Until now, Macs and PCs had a slew of chips for various processing and connectivity requirements,
				including the CPU, I/O, security, memory, and so on. Apple hopes to change this with the M1, which
				features a more compact and all-in-one design that brings all of the elements together to create a more
				efficient and powerful package. The company hopes to make it easier for the system to use all of the
				different resources required for various operations from a single pool within the package by doing so.
				As a result, the machine (on which it is installed) will provide a well-rounded performance with
				increased efficiency.

			<h2>Traditional Computing with ARM</h2>

				<figcaption>Windows PC based on Arm.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Recently, we've seen a shift in this trend, with an influx of well-received ARM-based processors for
				PCs. Qualcomm and Microsoft announced the first Windows 10 devices with ARM-based processors at the end
				of 2017. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor is now available in laptops and convertibles from HP, Asus,
				and Lenovo. Microsoft's previous attempts to marry mobile processors with full laptop experiences were
				rebooted with Windows 10 on ARM.
			</p>
			<p>
				In comparison to current x86 Intel-based computers, it promises to provide better power efficiency,
				consistent performance, and always-on connectivity. Qualcomm claims that these ARM devices will have a
				battery life of up to 25 hours, as well as instant power on and performance comparable to that of an
				Intel computer. It also claims that the built-in LTE connectivity will deliver significantly faster
				speeds than other LTE-enabled Windows 10 computers currently on the market. Furthermore, over the last
				few years, Microsoft has steadily improved Windows support for ARM chips, and its upcoming
				architecture-agnostic Lite OS is further proof that the company is serious about having more ARM-powered
				laptops.

			<h2>The Final Thoughts for the Future</h2>
			<p>
				To summarize, we can expect a new and exciting range of products to hit the market as a result of
				advances in ARM architecture and the improved 7nm lithography process in the semiconductor industry, as
				well as leading manufacturers investing in the development of ARM-based devices. With this predicted
				development path, we can only hope that in the future, our computational devices will provide us with
				excellent performance and efficiency, allowing us to focus on what we do best: creativity and
				innovation.
